# 📑 What is the difference between QA, QC, and Testing?
---
## 🛡️ Quality Assurance (QA)
* **Definition:** A process-oriented, proactive, and preventive approach.
* **Goal:** Focuses on the implementation and improvement of processes to prevent defects before they occur.
* **Scope:** Applies to both development and testing processes.
* **Responsibility:** It is the responsibility of everyone on the project.
* 🔄 **In Agile:** Includes retrospectives for sprint improvements, "lessons learned" sessions, and Root Cause Analysis (RCA).

## 🔍 Quality Control (QC)

* **Definition:** A product-oriented, reactive, and corrective approach.
* **Goal:** Focuses on activities that support the achievement of appropriate quality levels by identifying defects in the work products.
* **Scope:** Includes all activities used to evaluate the status of work products (requirements, architecture, code, etc.) across all stages (planning, analysis, design).
* 🛠️ **Key Activities**:
   * **Static Testing:** Reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections (checking documents/code without running them).
   * **Dynamic Testing:** Test execution (running the software to find defects).
   * **Other Methods:** Simulation, prototyping, and formal proof of correctness.

## 🧪 Testing
* **Definition:**  A major part of Dynamic QC.
* **The "Execution" Part:** This is where you provide inputs, exercise the software, and compare actual results with expected results.
* **Goal:** The process of operating a system or component under specified conditions, observing or recording the results, and making an evaluation.
* **Distinction:** While often used interchangeably with "test execution," formal testing includes planning, analysis, design, and reporting.
* **Other QC Forms:** Testing sits alongside simulation, prototyping, and formal methods (model checking).
* **Role in QC:** While QC is the broader category of "checking the product," Testing is the primary tool used to perform that check during the later stages of development.

> Test results are used by QA and QC. In QC they are used to fix defects, while in QA they
> provide feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing.
