# 📋 Test Process: Activities, Testware and Roles
(Based on ISTQB v4.0 & ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-2)

Although many of these activities may appear to follow a logical sequence, they are often implemented iteratively or in parallel, for example in Agile. 


| **Test Stages** | **Core Activity (Goal)** | **Testware** | **Test roles** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |:--- |
| **Test planning**| Consists of defining the test objectives and then selecting an approach that best achieves the objectives | Test plan, Test schedule, Risk register, entry and exit criteria. The all last ones may be a part of Test plan   | Test management role |
| **Test monitoring and control**| Test monitoring invoolves the ongoing checking of all test activities and the comparison of actual progress against the plan. Test control involves taking the actions necessary to meet the objectives of testing. In Agile repeate everi sprint or zero sprint| Test progress reports (in Agile daily), documentation of control directives and risk information| Test management role |
| **Test analysis**| What to test? in terms of measurable coverage criteeria. Analyzing the test basis to identify testable features and to define and  prioritize associated test conditions, together with the related risks and risk levels. Static testing for test basis. Activity supported by the use of test techniques | Prioritized test conditions (e.g., acceptance criteria), defect reports regarding defects in the test basis (if not fixed directly) | The testing role |
| **Test design**| How to test? Includes elaborating the test conditions into test cases and other testware (decision table, diagram, test charter), identification of coverage items, which serve as a guide to specify test case inputs. test techniques can be used. Includes defining the test data requirements, designing in test enviroment and identifying any other required infrastucture and  tools  | Prioritized test cases, test charters, coverage items, test data requirements and test environment requirements | The testing role  |
| **Test implementation**|Include creating the testware necessary for test execution (test data). Test cases can be organized into test procedures and are often assembled into test suites. Manualand automated test scripts are created. The test enviroment is built and verified to be set up correctly. Test procedures are prioritized and arranged within a test execution schedule for efficient test execution | Test procedures, autimated test scripts, test suites, test data, test execution schedule, test enviroment elements (e.g., stubs, drivers, simulations, and service virtualizations).  | The testing role  |
| **Test execution**| Includes running the tests in accordance with the test execution schedule (test runs). can be manual or automated. actual test results are compared with the expected results. the test results are logged. Anomalies are analyzed to identify their likely causes. Here are all test levels: componrnt, integration, system, system integration and acceptace. | Test logs, Defect reports|  The testing role  |
| **Test completion**|Occur at project milestone (e.g, release, end of iteration, test level complition) for any unresolved defects, change requests or product backklog items created. the test enviroment is shut down to an agreed state. the test activities are analyzed to identify lessons learned and improvements for future iterations, releases, or projects. A Test complition report is created and communicated to the stakeholders. For Scrum team: retro, demo, sprint review, * demo = test summary report as meeting. | Test complition report, action items for improvement of subsequent projects or iterations, documrnted lessons learned, and change requests (e.g., as product backlog items) | Test management role |
