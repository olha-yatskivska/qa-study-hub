### **🪜 Test Object Scope by Test Level**

The scope of a **Test Object** changes and expands depending on the **Test Level**:

- **Component Level:** Modules, functions, classes, or code units.
- **Component Integration Level:** Interactions and interfaces between modules or microservices.
- **System Level:** Specific features, parts of the system, or the entire system as a whole.
- **System Integration Level:** Integration within the system or with external 3rd party data, services, and APIs.
- **Acceptance Testing:** The complete system, focused on business needs and user requirements.

---
> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Remember: Test Levels refer to Dynamic Testing.
> 
> For **Static Testing** (Non-Execution), the objects and goals are different:
> * **Test Objects:** Requirements (User Stories), Design Specs, Source Code, Test Plans, and User Manuals.
> * **Goal:** Finding defects in work products *before* the code is even run.

**Static testing finds defects, while dynamic testing finds failures.**
