# What is the difference between QA, QC, and Testing?

* **QC** is a ***product-oriented***, reactive, corrective approach that focuses on those activities supporting the achievement of appropriate levels of quality. 
* **QC** includes all activities to evaluate status of all work products (requirement, architect, unit tests) at all testing activities (e.g.planning, test analysis, test design). 
* **Testing** (test execution) is a major form from of quality control, while other include formal methods (model checking and proof of correctness), simulation and prototyping. 
* **QA** is a ***process-oriented***, proactive, preventive approach that focuses on the implementation and improvement of processes. 
* **QA** applies to both the development and testing processes, and is the responsibility of everyone on a project. 
* Test results are used by QA and QC. In QC they are used to fix defects, while in QA they provide feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing. 
* QA in Agile - retro for improvements for next sprint, lessons learn, root cause analysis.
