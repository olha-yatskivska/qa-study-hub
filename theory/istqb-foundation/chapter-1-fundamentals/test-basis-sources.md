    * **URS** (*User Requirements Specification*): Needs and expectations of end-users. (User Stories and Acceptance Criteria for Agile)
    * **FRS/FS** (*Functional Requirements Specification*): Specific functions the system must perform. (Use Case)
    * **NFRs** (*Non-Functional Requirements*): Performance, security, usability, reliability, compatibility, etc.

    * Models & Diagrams (Flow Diagrams, State Diagrams, Process Models).
    * System and Interface Architecture Specifications.
---
* **User Documentation:**
    * User Manuals
    * Installation Guides
    * Online Help & Knowledge Bases.
---
* **Technical & External Sources:**
    * **Product Risk Analysis** (used for Risk-Based Testing).
    * **Source Code** (for White-box testing).
    * **Test Oracle** (sources used to determine expected results (can be an old system, a manual, or even specialized software)).
    * **Competitors** (benchmarking and analysis similar products).
    * Applicable laws and regulatory standards.
