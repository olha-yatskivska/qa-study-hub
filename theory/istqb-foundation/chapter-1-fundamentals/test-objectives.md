# 🪜 Test Objectives
---
* **Evaluating work products:** Reviewing requirements, user stories, designs , and code (***Static testing***).
* **Triggering failures:** Exwcuting the software to find defects (***Dynamic testing***).
* **Ensuring required coverage** of a test object (code, requirements, or risks).
* **Risk Reducing:**Proactively lowering the level of risk regarding inadequate software quality.
* **Verification:** Checking whether specified requirements have been fulfilled.
* **Compliance:** Verifying that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and requirements.
* **Stakeholder Support:** Providing necessary information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions.
* **Confidence Building:** Creating trust in the quality level of the test object.
* **Validation:** Checking whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders.

## Objectives of Testing vary depending on:
* **Work Product:** Testing a technical design document (Static) feels different from testing a mobile app (Dynamic).
* **Test Level:** Component testing focuses on code logic, while Acceptance testing focuses on user needs.
* **Risks:** High-risk areas (like payment gateways) require more intensive objectives than low-risk areas (like a "Contact Us" page).
* **SDLC Model:**  Agile projects focus on rapid feedback, while Sequential (Waterfall) models focus on formal verification.
* **Corporate Structure:** A large regulated corporation may prioritize Compliance, whereas a small agency may prioritize Speed.
* **Competitive Considerations:** Features might be tested for "market parity" to match what competitors offer.
* **Time to Market:** Strict deadlines might shift the objective from "zero bugs" to "zero critical bugs" to ensure a timely launch.
