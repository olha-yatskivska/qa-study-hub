## Frequent customer engagement reduces the expectation gap

* The best way to minimize the expectation gap is to arrange frequent contact points with suitable customer representatives.

* These contact points can take the form of:
  * interviews
  * conversations
  * requirements reviews
  * user interface design walkthroughs
  * prototype evaluations
  * user feedback on small increments of executable software (in Agile).

* Each contact point affords an opportunity to close the expectation gap: what the developer builds is more closely aligned with what the customer needs.
