# Establishing the business requirements

* Business requirements issues must be resolved before the functional and nonfunctional requirements can be fully specified. 
* Set measurable targets with business objectives, and then define success metrics that allow you to measure whether you are on  track to meet those objectives.
* The business benefit has to represent a true value for the project’s sponsors and to the product’s customers.
* Two core elements of the business requirements are the vision and the scope.
  
> Important: The product vision ensures that we all know where we are hoping to go eventually.
>  The project scope ensures that we are all talking about the same thing for the immediate project or iteration.

* Business requirements collected from multiple sources might conflict.
* The vision and scope document collects the business requirements into a single deliverable that 
sets the stage for the subsequent development work: a project  charter or a business case document, a market (or marketing) requirements document (MRD).
