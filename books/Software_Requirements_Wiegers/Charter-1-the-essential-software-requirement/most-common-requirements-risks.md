#  Most common requirements risks

* **Insufficient user involvement:** leads to late-breaking requirements that generate rework and delay completion.


* **Inaccurate planning:** Estimating project effort and duration based on requirements means that you need to know something about the size of your requirements and the development team’s productivity.


* **Creeping user requirements:** Agile projects take the approach of adjusting the scope for a certain iteration to fit into a defined budget and duration for the iteration. As new requirements come along, they are placed into the backlog of pending work and allocated to future iterations based on priority.


* **Ambiguous requirements:** One way to ferret out ambiguity is to have people who represent different perspectives inspect the requirements. Writing tests against the requirements and building prototypes are other ways to discover ambiguities.


* **Gold plating:** Developers should strive for leanness and simplicity, not going beyond what stakeholders request without their approval. Make sure that what you are specifying and developing lies within the project’s scope.


* **Overlooked stakeholders:** If you don’t identify the important user classes for your product early on, some user needs won’t be met (support staff , marketing department, data migration team, government agencies).
